# 11. Which code fragment is the correct way to open a session?
#
# a.
# from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session
# session = Session(system='ibm_foo')
#
# b.
# from qiskit_ibm_runtime import execute, QiskitRuntimeService
# service = QiskitRuntimeService()
# session = execute(service=service)
#
# c.
# from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Session, QiskitRuntimeService
# service = QiskitRuntimeService()
# session = Session(service.least_busy())
#
# d.
# from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
# session = QuantumCircuit(2).open_session()

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from math import pi

# --- Step 1: Define a simple circuit to illustrate a session workflow ---
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
qc.ry(pi / 4, 0)
qc.measure_all()

# --- Step 2: Simulate connecting to Qiskit Runtime service (mocked for offline demo) ---
print("\nSimulating Qiskit Runtime session creation...")

# In a real environment, you would initialize the service like this:
# service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel='ibm_quantum')

# --- Step 3: Demonstrate each code fragment conceptually ---

# (a)
print("\n(a) Session(system='ibm_foo') — Incorrect: 'system' is not a valid Session argument.")

# (b)
print("(b) execute(service=service) — Incorrect: 'execute' is a different function, not for sessions.")

# (c)
print("(c) Session(service.least_busy()) — Illustrates connecting to the least-busy backend via the service.")

# (d)
print("(d) QuantumCircuit.open_session() — Invalid: QuantumCircuit objects cannot open sessions directly.")

# --- Step 4: (Optional Mock Example) Correct Session Usage Pattern ---
print("\nExample of real-world usage (mocked for demonstration):")
print("from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, SamplerV2")
print("service = QiskitRuntimeService()")
print("backend = service.least_busy(simulator=True)")
print("with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:")
print("    # Run a sampler or estimator job here")
print("    pass")

# --- Step 5: Summary ---
"""
SUMMARY:
        This question checks your understanding of how to correctly create a Qiskit Runtime Session.
        Only one of the code fragments correctly constructs a Session object with a valid service 
        and backend reference. The others use incorrect or unsupported arguments or functions.
