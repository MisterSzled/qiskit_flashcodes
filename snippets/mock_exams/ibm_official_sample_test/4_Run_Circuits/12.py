# 12. Which one of the following patterns, expressed in terms of array broadcasting
# primitives, is represented by the given image?

# Parameter Value Sets: (3, 6)
# Observables Array:   (2, 3, 1)
# Resulting EV Estimates: (2, 3, 6)
#
# a. Standard multidimensional array generalization
# b. All-to-all
# c. Extended dimensional variation
# d. Best effort broadcasting

# NumPy automatically applies broadcasting rules
# to combine these arrays into a (2,3,6) result.

SUMMARY:
This demonstrates Qiskit's array broadcasting concept as used in primitives such as Estimator:
        - Parameter Value Sets (3,6) define multiple parameter sweeps.
        - Observables (2,3,1) define multiple circuits/observables over those sweeps.
        - The broadcasted result (2,3,6) shows how Qiskit pairs them dimensionally.

Each exam option refers to a pattern of broadcasting behavior used to compute
Expectation Value (EV) arrays within Qiskit Runtime Primitives.
