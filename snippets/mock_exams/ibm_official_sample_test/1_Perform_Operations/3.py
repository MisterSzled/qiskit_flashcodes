Qiskit v2.x Exam Flashcard

Question 3:
Given the following code fragment, what is the approximate probability 
that a measurement would result in a bit value of 1?

        from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
        import numpy as np
        qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
        qc.reset(0)
        qc.ry(np.pi / 2, 0)
        qc.measure_all()

Choices:
        a. 0.8536
        b. 1.0
        c. 0.1464
        d. 0.5

SUMMARY:
        - Reset ensures qubit starts in |0>.
        - RY(Ï€/2) rotation places qubit into superposition.
        - Measurement results give empirical probability of state |1>.
        - Compare printed probability with the provided choices.
