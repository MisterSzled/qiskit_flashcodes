SUMMARY:
        - PUB = Primitive Unified Block â†’ standardized input format for primitives.
        - Sampler PUB: [circuits]
        - Estimator PUB: [(circuit, observable)]
        - PUBs are just lists/tuples, ensuring a consistent API for SamplerV2/EstimatorV2.
        - In Qiskit 2.x+, use SamplerV2 and EstimatorV2 from `qiskit_ibm_runtime`.
